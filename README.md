**A library of movies.**

## Description

Movies App built in React ^16.13.1 which will display all movies from [The Movie Database API](https://www.themoviedb.org/) and all the details about each movie.

I used:

- React (mainly functional components and hooks)
- React Router
- FetchAPI
- Styled Components
- PropTypes

### Api Key:

Get an api key from [TMDB Api](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api)
Create an .env file in the root of the project and put your API key.
**Example content of .env file:**
REACT_APP_API = yourapikey

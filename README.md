**_ Movies App 2020 _**

![Preview Image](src/images/movies-app-preview.png)

# A library of movies.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Description

Movies App built in React ^16.13.1 which will display all movies from [The Movie Database API](https://www.themoviedb.org/) and all the details about each movie.

I used:

- React (mainly functional components and hooks)
- React Router
- FetchAPI
- Styled Components
- PropTypes

### Api Key:

Get an api key from [TMDB Api](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api)
Create an .env file in the root of the project and put your API key.
**Example content of .env file:**
REACT_APP_API = yourapikey

#### Installation Npm

--- to install all dependencies : npm install
`npm start` - Runs the app in the development mode.
`npm build` - Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
`npm test` - Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
`npm eject` - If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

#### Installation Yarn

--- to install all dependencies : yarn install
`yarn start` - Runs the app in the development mode.
`yarn build` - Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
`yarn test` - Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
`yarn eject` - If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

**_Enjoy, Stefan _**
